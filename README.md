# scenic-ins-analysis

A Python project to accompany the paper 
"Speed versus Accuracy Emphasis Inverts Effects of Stimulus Class on 2AFC Recognition"
by [M. B. Moreland](https://github.com/moreland-hood) 
and [J. M. Dusel](https://johnmdusel.github.io/).

This repository provides:

1. **Bayesian data analysis** for empirical aggregated response accuracy data using [PyMC](https://pymc.io). 
Our analyses are inspired by similar analyses from 
[*Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2ed* by J. Kruschke](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/).

2. **Bayesian diffusion modeling** using [HSSM](https://lnccbrown.github.io/HSSM/).

Our priors are based on data from a previous related study 
["Response Time and Encoding Strength: Moderating the Choice Similarity Effect"](https://osf.io/67pnw/files/osfstorage?view_only=632d8f9e3f64450cb23483e7a2a10678)
by M. B. Moreland and S. E. Clark (2025).

This repository is adapted to the datasets for the experiment reported in our paper.
Fpr example, our methods for computing experimental effects could be re-used in another context, 
but you would need to clean out hardcoded assumptions about our data.

## 1. Using this repository

Be sure that Docker is installed on your system.
Open the root directory of this project in a terminal session.
 
### 1.1 Build the Docker image

The first step creates a file named `.env` that contains your user ID and group ID. 
Docker will read this file while building the image and set up a user having your user ID and group ID.
That way, the output files generated by the analysis will be owned by your account, not `root`.

```
echo -e "USERNAME=$USER\nUSER_UID=$(id -u $USER)\nGROUPNAME=$(id -gn $USER | sed 's/ /_/g')\nGROUP_GID=$(id -g $USER)" > .env
```

The second step is to build the image. 

```
docker build -t "scenic-ins" .
```


### 1.2 Run the analyses

Run the analyses from a terminal session inside the root directory of this project.
By default, both analysis will run 16 MCMC chains for 1,000 burn-in steps followed by 2,000 draws.
The MCMC sampler will attempt to assign one chain per core.
See below for advice on changing these settings.
   
#### 1.2.1 Empirical proportion correct/response time analyses
 
Takes about 4 minutes on DELL XPS 15 9500 (Intel Core i7-10875H CPU @ 2.30GHz x 16, 64.0 GB memory). 
Takes 128 seconds on DELL Precision 7920 (Intel Xeon Gold 6138 CPU @ 2.00GHz x 80, 125.5 GB memory).

```
./scripts/run_empirical_data_analysis.sh
```

#### 1.2.2 Diffusion modeling

Takes about 11 hours on DELL Precision 7920 (ntel Xeon Gold 6138 CPU @ 2.00GHz x 80, 125.5 GB memory).

```
./scripts/run_diffusion_modeling.sh
```

## 2. Inspecting the code

This project is organized into separate analysis for proportion correct, response time, diffusion 
modeling, and posterior predictive checks.
We recommend first reading the scripts `src/run_empirical_data_analysis.py` or `src/run_diffusion_modeling.py` 
to learn the high-level steps. 
Important classes and methods have docstrings that describe their inputs, outputs, and purpose.

### 2.1 The `config.yaml` file

This is where paths and file names are hardcoded. 
The default values are adequate to reproduce our results. 
To experiment with different parameter settings consider modifying the `'savedir'` entry.


### 2.2 Changing parameter settings

Parameter settings have to be changed in the Python scripts themselves. 
For example, to change the number of MCMC chains or the length of an MCMC chain, 
look at the `McmcAnalysis` class defined in `src/analysis.py`. 


## 3. About the data

### `data/Expt1{a,c}_Fig.csv`

Data from Experiments 1a/1c from by M. B. Moreland and S. E. Clark (2025).
Follow the OSF link above to read explanations of the columns.
These files are used in `src.prior.get_pc_analysis_prior` to set the prior for the $p(c)$ analyses.
See `src.run_empirical_data_analysis` around line 22, `src.run_diffusion_model_analysis` around lines 53, 81,  
and also `config.yaml`.

### `data/Scenic_Params.csv`

Each row holds a diffusion model parameter estimate 
based on the results from Experiments 1a/1c of M. B. Moreland and S. E. Clark (2025).
Column `params` indicates which of $\delta, \alpha, \beta, \tau$ the row is for, 
and `par` is the value of that parameter.
We used the columns `par` and `params` in `src.prior.get_hssm_prior` to set priors for the HSSM analysis.
See `src.run_diffusion_modeling` around lines 25 and 48 and also `config.yaml`.

### `data/SCENICINS_FullDat.csv`

These data are used in the diffusion modeling scripts, passed down from `src.run_diffusion_modeling` around lines 24 and 49.
They are also used for RT analyses, passed dowm from `src.run_empirical_data_analysis` around lines 21, 45, 57.
See also `config.yaml`.
Each row holds the result of a single trial. 
Column `rt` is the response time in sec on a trial, 
`response` is response accuracy coded as `1` for correct and `-1` for error , 
`Cond` is the level of stimulus class coded as `AA` or `AB`,
`Ins` is the level of instructions coded as `Acc` or `Spd`,
`participant_id` is the participant ID.

### `data/ScenicInsAggregated.csv`

These data are used in the empirical data analysis scripts, passed down from `src.run_empirical_data_analysis` 
around line 20 and `src.run_diffusion_modeling` around lines 47 and 100. 
See also `config.yaml`.
Each row holds the mean response accuracy `pc` for a participant for a joint level of stimulus class and instructions.
The mean response accuracy was computed using the `response` values from `data/SCENICINS_FullDat.csv` 
coded as 1 for correct and 0 for error.
Column `Cond` is the level of stimulus class coded as `AA` or `AB`,
`Ins` is the level of instructions coded as `Acc` or `Spd`,
`participant_id` is the participant ID.
